Hi, sir.
I have already developed Binance trading bot.
The strategy was like this.
1) BUY:
1-10-10 (example 14:00 - 13:50 - 13:40).
When analyzing, Close prices are compared to Close prices, and Low prices are compared to Low prices.

Explanation:
we take prices close and low and compare to the prices 10 minutes ago and 20 minutes ago
If the price 10 min ago increased from the price 20 min ago and if the price NOW increased from the price 10 min ago - we BUY

2) SELL
Selling strategy - crypto price in real-time:
1. Stop loss -0.5% of the purchase price
2. Stop loss +0.7% of the purchase price
3. Stop loss floating -1.5% of the highest price since the last purchase. Applied when the selling price >= of stop loss of 2.
*A SELL occurs if the price falls TO or BELOW any of the stop losses.

And I recorded all the prices into csv file.
I also recorded all the logs while trading is implemented.
Perhaps if you hire me, you will get the result.
I'm looking forward to your response.
Thanks.
